            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I finished "A. L. Papiu Ilarian" highscool in 2021 and the same
                year started studying computer science at "UMFST Tg-Mures".<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;In those two years of study I started working on idividual 
                projects based on microcontrollers for the fun of dooing it 
                and to learn something new , diffrent from what our teacher 
                were supposed to teach.
