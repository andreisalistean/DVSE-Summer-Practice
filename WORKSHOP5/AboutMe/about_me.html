                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hi, my name is Andrei , I'm 21 years old ,a teen IT student at the university
                of "UMFST" ,at the start of my career .<br>
                &emsp;In my free time i like to listen to music , ride my bike and walk in the woods, 
                to disconnect from the rest of the word, but when it's time to get work done 
                I pull myself together  and start to do my best.
                <br>&emsp;When it comes to programming i prefer to work with java  in mobile projects 
                in Android Studio  and C++ for projects that require microcontrollers like arduino, 
                ESP32  and so on.  
            </p>
